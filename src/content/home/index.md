Hey! I’m Timothy Lau, a fanatical open sourceror and full-stack developer who spends more time debugging code than debugging life.

Working at :link{#@yuanze-dev}

Programming has been my lifelong companion, and the enthusiasm never let up. Even now, writing code is the place I return to when life gets heavy. It relaxes me, inspires me.

My grand ambition? To build something genuinely meaningful—whether it’s a tiny tool that makes someone say “oh nice,” or a silly little project that sparks unexpected joy. If someone finds value in it, my motivation bar refills instantly.

When I’m not building things, you’ll probably find me traveling, diving into electronic music, or losing badminton games with grace. And when I feel contemplative, my mind wanders to astronomy, cosmology, physics—the big stuff I haven’t had time to truly explore… yet.
